    I love fish.
    The kind that is alive and swims around in an aquarium or river, or a lake, and definitely the ocean.
    Fun fact is that I have several aquariums and also a river.
    I like eating fish, too. Raw fish. Grilled fish. Smoked fish. Poached fish - not so much.
    And sometimes I even go fishing.
    And even less sometimes, I actually catch something.
    Once, when I was camping in Canada, and very hungry, I even caught a large salmon with my hands.
    I\'ll be happy to teach you how to make your own aquarium.
    You should ask someone else about fishing, though.</string>
