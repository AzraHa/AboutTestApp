    The kind that is alive and swims around in an aquarium or river, or a lake, and definitely the ocean.\nFun fact is that I have several aquariums and also a river.\nI like eating fish, too. Raw fish. Grilled fish. Smoked fish. Poached fish - not so much.\nAnd sometimes I even go fishing.\nAnd even less sometimes, I actually catch something.
    Once, when I was camping in Canada, and very hungry, I even caught a large salmon with my hands.\nI\'ll be happy to teach you how to make your own aquarium.
    You should ask someone else about fishing, though.</string>
